        Boggle™ is a word game played with 16 dice each having 6 faces labelled
        with a letter of the English alphabet. One die has a face labelled with
        the string <code>QU</code>        to reflect the fact that
        <code>Q</code> is usually followed by <code>U</code> in English words.

        To start a game of Boggle™, the dice are placed in a dome that covers
        the game board and the dice are shaken to randomize where each dice
        appears on the board and to randomize which face is up on each dice. The
        game board is simply a 4-by-4 grid.

        into one of the grid positions, the board is placed down and the dome
        removed. A 3-minute timer is started. The players then search the
        assortment of letters to find English words made up of three or more
        letters. Words are formed from letters that adjoin horizontally,
        vertically, or diagonally with no die being used more than once per
        word. The image to the left shows an example of how the word
        <code>QUESTIONS</code> can be formed. Other words that can be formed

      <h2>Implementing Boggle™ as a Java program</h2>

      <p>
        In this lab, students will create 3 essential classes for implementing
        Boggle™ as a Java program. The completed program has the following
        appearance when run:
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="./EECS2030 Lab 04_files/app.png">
      </p>

      <p>
        Our Boggle™ app has many features:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The player starts the game by pressing the <b>Re-roll</b> button.
        This causes the dice to be shaken and rolled randomly.
        </li>
        <li>It uses buttons to represent the dice; the user clicks on the
        buttons to form words. When the player clicks on a button, the button
        background is set to blue and the button is disabled so that the button
        can only be used once per word. Also, all of the other buttons not
        adjacent to the last clicked button are disabled; in this way the player
        is forced to use letters that form a connected path. In the image above,
        the last button pressed was the
          <b>E</b>; we can see that only the <b>N</b> and the <b>C</b> buttons
          are enabled (black text).
        </li>
        <li>As the player clicks on the dice buttons, the word being formed is
        shown in the text field at the bottom middle; in the image above, the
        user is currently spelling the word <b>DOUSE</b>.
        </li>
        <li>The player presses the <b>Submit</b> button when they are finished
        spelling the word. The word is checked to see if it is spelled correctly
        and is at least 3 letters long; if both of these are true, then the word
        is added to the list of correct words. Otherwise, the word is added to
        the list of incorrect words. In either case, the word is cleared from
        the text field, and all of the buttons are enabled and set to white so
        that the player can enter the next word.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You can play the Boggle™ app in the Prism lab using the command:
      </p>

      <pre>java -jar /cse/dept/www/course/2030/labs/lab4/BoggleApp.jar
</pre>

      <p>
        Ignoring the user interface, we can identify three components needed to
        implement a Java version of Boggle™:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          dice whose faces are decorated with a string
        </li>
        <li>
          a dictionary to determine if a word has been spelled correctly
        </li>
        <li>
          a component that models how the game of Boggle™ is played
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        In this lab, students will create these components by implementing three
        classes:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <code>Die</code>: A class that represents an n-sided die that can be
          rolled to display a random face. Each face of the die is decorated
          with a string. A <code>Die</code> is a composition of a
          <code>SortedMap</code> that stores which string is associated with
          each face of the die.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>Dictionary</code>: A class that represents a dictionary of
          English words. A <code>Dictionary</code> is a composition of a
          <code>SortedSet</code> strings (the words in the dictionary).
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>Boggle</code>: A class that models how the game of Boggle™ is
          played. A <code>Boggle</code> object is a composition of 16
          <code>Die</code> objects (the 16 dice used in the game) and a
          composition of a <code>Dictionary</code>.
        </li>
      </ol>

            <li>Under the <b>File</b> menu choose <b>Import...</b>
            </li>

            <li>Under <b>General</b> choose <b>Existing Projects into

            <li>Click the <b>Select archive file</b> radio button, and click the
            <b>Browse...</b> button.
            </li>

            <li>In the file browser that appears, navigate to your download
            directory (exactly where this is depends on what computer you
            working on; on the lab computers the file will probably appear in
            your home directory)
            </li>

            <li>Select the file <b>lab4.zip</b> and click <b>OK</b>

          </li></ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Implement the three classes <code>Die</code>, <code>Dictionary</code>,
            and <code>Boggle</code> (in that order). See the hints for implementing
            these classes below. <a href="https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/course_archive/2017-18/F/2030/labs/lab4/Lab4.api/index.html">The API for the 
            classes can be found here.</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            When all three classes are implemented you can run
            <code>BoggleApp.java</code> to play a game of Boggle™.
          </li>
      </ol>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h3>Hints for implementing the Die class</h3>

      <p>
        Rolling a <code>Die</code> to a random face of the die requires
        generating a random value. <code>java.util.Random</code> can
        easily be used to generate random integer values within a specified
        range, but our die faces are labelled with strings. One solution is to
        assign each face a unique integer value and map that value to the string
        on the face. Your solution should number the faces of the die 1, 2, 3,
        ..., n where n is the number of faces on the die, and store the face
        number and corresponding face string in a <code>SortedMap</code>. For
        example, consider a 4-sided die with faces labelled <code>"E"</code>,
        <code>"E"</code>, <code>"C"</code>, <code>"S"</code>; the <code>Die</code>
        object representing such a die might have the following map:
      </p>

      <table>
        <tbody><tr>
          <th>Key&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>
          <th>Value</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>"E"</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>"E"</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>"C"</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>4</td>
          <td>"S"</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody></table>

      <p>
        <code>Die</code> is a composition of a <code>SortedMap</code>;
        any constructor or method that might leak a reference to the map 
        must make a defensive copy of the map.
        The <code>Die</code> constructor should create and initialize the map
        given an array of strings specifying the strings for the faces.
      </p>

      <p>
        A field for the map is already in the provided <code>Die.java</code>
        file. You may find that you require additional fields as you implement
        the various methods; don't forget to initialize these fields to
        reasonable values in the constructor.
      </p>

      <h3>Hints for implementing the Dictionary class</h3>

      <p>
        The <code>Dictionary</code> class uses a <code>SortedSet</code>
        to store the words of the dictionary. We use a set to prevent
        storing duplicate words. We use a sorted set because certain
        dictionary operations can be implemented more efficiently if 
        a sorted set is used instead of an unsorted set (although it
        is not a requirement that students exploit the possible 
        efficiencies). <code>Dictionary</code> is a composition of a 
        <code>SortedSet</code>; any constructor or method that might leak
        a reference to the set must make a defensive copy of the set.
      </p>

      <p>
        The dictionary reads in the words of the dictionary from a 
        file named <code>dictionary.txt</code> that has been provided
        to you. The file contains
        370,101 English words in all lower case. A method that reads
        the file has also been provided for you. Note that the dictionary
        file contains many acronyms and abbreviations that would not
        normally be accepted as proper words.
      </p>

      <h3>Hints for implementing the Boggle class</h3>

      <p>
        The <code>Boggle</code> class is a composition of a <code>Dictionary</code>
        and a <code>List</code> of 16 <code>Die</code> objects; any constructor
        or method that might leak a reference to the <code>Dictionary</code>
        or the <code>List</code> of dice must make a defensive copy of
        the <code>Dictionary</code> or the <code>List</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <code>Boggle</code> constructor should create a dictionary and
        a list to store the dice; it should populate the list with 16 dice.
        The strings to label the 16 dice are provided to you in the 
        file <code>Boggle.java</code> as a 2-dimensional array named
        <code>LETTERS</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can get the 1-dimensional array containing the strings for 
        the faces of the first die by writing:
      </p>

      <pre>String[] faces = Boggle.LETTERS[0];
</pre>

      <p>
        In the above example, <code>Boggle.LETTERS[0]</code> is the first
        element of the 2-dimensional array <code>LETTERS</code>; the first 
        element is itself an array of six strings. Similarly,
        <code>Boggle.LETTERS[1]</code> is the array of six strings for 
        the faces of the second die, and
        <code>Boggle.LETTERS[2]</code> is the array of six strings for 
        the faces of the third die.
      </p>
        
      <p>
        Creating 16 dice can be done by writing a loop:
      </p>

      <pre>for (int i = 0; i &lt; Boggle.NUMBER_OF_DICE; i++) {
    String[] faces = Boggle.LETTERS[i];
    // make a Die using faces here
    // add the die to your list here
}
</pre>
    </div>

      <p>
        If you are <i>not</i> working in a group, submit your solution using the
        <code>submit</code> command. Remember that you first need to find your
        workspace directory, then you need to find your project directory. In
        your project directory, your files will be located in the directory
        <code>src/eecs2030/lab3</code></p>

      <h2>Submit for students working in a group</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Students working in a group should submit only one submission for the
        entire group.</b> If you are working in a group, create a plain text
        file named
        <code>group.txt</code>. You can do this in eclipse using the menu
        <i>File -&gt; New -&gt; File</i>. Type your login names into the file with
        each login name on its own line. For example, if the students with login
        names
        <code>rey</code>, <code>finn</code>, and <code>dameronp</code>, worked
        in a group the contents of <code>group.txt</code>        would be:
      </p>

      <pre>  rey finn dameronp

      <p>Submit your solution using the <code>submit</code> command. Remember

      <h2>Submit your work from outside the Prism lab</h2>

      <p>
        It is possible to submit work from outside the Prism lab, but the
        process is not trivial; do not attempt to do so at the last minute if
        the process is new to you. The process for submitting from outside of
        the Prism lab involves the following steps:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>transfer the files from your computer to the undergraduate EECS
        server red.eecs.yorku.ca
        </li>
        <li>remotely log in to your EECS account
        </li>
        <li>submit your newly transferred files in your remote login session
        using the instructions for submitting from within the lab
        </li>
        <li>repeat Steps 1 and 3 as required
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Windows users will likely need to install additional software first. Mac
        users have all of the required software as part of MacOS.
